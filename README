hwmon module tests
------------------

Run test with:
	sudo ./module-test.sh <driver-name>

Example:
	sudo ./module-test.sh lm93

module-test.sh currently assumes that the Linux source directory
is ../linux-staging, and copies the source file from there into
the current directory.

Various test scripts are available in the scripts/ directory.

The register dumps in directory register-dumps/ may be useful
for writing additional scripts.
